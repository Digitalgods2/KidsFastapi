OPTIMIZED COVER PROMPT FOR GPT-IMAGE-1:

A whimsical children's book cover illustration featuring:

SCENE: A joyful, ghostly figure of Marley in chains floats above a snowy Victorian street, surrounded by twinkling stars and softly glowing lanterns. Below, a silhouetted Scrooge - a grumpy old man with a top hat and furrowed brow - stands hunched over clutching a money bag. In the background, a cozy warmly-lit window shows a happy family celebrating Christmas. The color palette uses deep blues and whites for the night sky, contrasted with warm yellows and reds from the windows, creating a magical atmosphere blending mystery and joy.

TEXT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- At the TOP CENTER: Display the title "A Christmas Carol" in elegant, large, clearly readable script font
- At the BOTTOM: Display "Written by Charles Dickens" in a playful, clearly readable font
- BOTH text elements must be LEGIBLE, CRISP, and PROMINENT
- Use contrasting colors to ensure text stands out (white or yellow text against dark background)
